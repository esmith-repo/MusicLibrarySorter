You will need to export your Apple Music library. 

Open Apple Music, click File > Library > Export Library.

Save the file as "Library.xml" in your Documents folder.

Run the application and it will save the file, to your Documents folder, as a CSV.

Works well with large libraries. Program finished running in a few seconds for my library of over 30,000 tracks.

Enjoy!
